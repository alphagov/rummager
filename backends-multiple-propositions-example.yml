# This is an example development config for running different backends for
# government, specialist and mainstream content.
#
# Queries to theses indexes can be made calling GET /<index>/search?q=<query>
# while documents can be added or removed with requests such as
# POST /<index>/documents.  i.e. GET /mainstream/search?q=tax will return
# as json all mainstream results about tax.

# Setting primary and secondary to mainstream and specialist content affects
# requests that don't target an index, such as GET /search?q=<query>
