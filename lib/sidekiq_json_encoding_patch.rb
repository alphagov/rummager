module Sidekiq
  # Sidekiq, by default, lets the JSON library decide how to encode objects,
  # including how to encode non-ASCII strings. This causes encoding problems
  # if the client is dumping jobs as UTF-8 (which it will do with UTF-8 strings
  # by default) and the worker is trying to load them as ASCII (which it does
  # by default when reading from a socket). We can get around this problem
  # entirely by forcing ASCII-only encoding (using "\uxxxx" escape sequences).
  #
  # This didn't happen before we removed the activesupport gem, because that
  # delves into the JSON library and forces everything to encode and decode
  # UTF-8.
  def self.dump_json(object)
    JSON.generate(object, ascii_only: true)
