# MessageProcessor
#
# This class is instantiated by the rake task and passed to the message queue
# consumer.

# The consumer is currently using the message queue as a notification
# mechanism. When it gets a message that some content has changed, it simply
# re-indexes a document, which (among other things) triggers a new lookup of
# the links from the publishing-api.

      # processing, we don't want to retry the message really quickly because
      # that might overload elasticsearch or other components. This should be
      # replaced by a retry mechanism with exponential back-off.
